Most flow fields important to engineering applications are complex; many times being both
three dimensional and unsteady. Flow visualization techniques often reveal spatial and
temporal features of the flow, which are difficult to discern from single point measurements.
For this reason, flow visualization experiments often represent an important first step when
studying a new flow field of interest.
Dye injection is a relatively easy flow visualization technique that involves marking fluid
particles through the addition of a visible dye. In the lab, we will use a non-toxic, non-
staining, and biodegradable water tracing dye. The dye may be introduced into the water
channel in two ways: using a dye injection needle or through a port in the object of interest.
In the former, a thin rigid L-shaped tube is positioned upstream of the object of interest, with
the dye being feed through the top of the tube using flexible tubing connected to an elevated
dye reservoir. One problem with this method is that the dye injection needle can cause some
flow disturbance that interferes with the flow around the object of interest. In the lab, we
also have several objects with custom-made ports to allow the dye to be released through
a small hole on the surface of the object. This method of dye injection is preferred as it
avoids potential flow disturbance due to the release mechanism. In either case, the dye lines
released into the flow represent streaklines. Figure 1 shows a drawing of such a streakline.
Each of the eight fluid particles marked originated from the tip of the dye injection needle,
with particle 1 being injected first, and so on. Note, the streakline does not necessarily trace
out the trajectory of any single particle (this is only true for steady flow), but represents the
collection of fluid particles that passed through the tip of the dye injection needle at some
earlier time.
In the present experiments, a dye injection based flow visualization technique is used to
explore the flow of water past three types of geometric bodies: (i) cylinder, (ii) a long flat
plate, and (iii) an airfoil. In every case, at least two different flow speeds will be run to
observe the effects of changing Reynolds number. The Reynolds number is an important
nondimensional number defined by the following group of parameters: Re = U L/ν, where U
and L are characteristic velocity and length scales in the flow and ν represents the kinematic
viscosity of the fluid. In this case, U represents the flow speed, and L represents the size
of the object. The Reynolds number is important in fluid mechanics because, in nearly all
flow fields, a critical Reynolds number exists whereby the flow transitions from laminar to
turbulent behavior.
