A schematic of a four-stroke, spark ignition, internal combustion (IC) engine is shown in
Figure 1, along with a description of the function of each stroke. The power generated
during stroke (iii) is used to turn the crankshaft, which can then be used to drive the axle of
an automobile, for example, to produce mechanical work. The performance characterization
of such an engine involves specifying the amount of mechanical power (or brake power,  ̇Wb)
that can be produced as a function of the rotational speed (ω) of the crankshaft, as well as the
thermal efficiency (ηth). These physical quantities cannot be measured directly. Therefore, in
the laboratory, we measure surrogate quantities instead, and calculate the desired quantities
of interest based on known physical (and theoretical) relationships.
