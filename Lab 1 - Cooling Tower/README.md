A cooling tower is an open-system that rejects waste heat to the atmosphere through the
evaporative cooling of a hot water stream. The purpose of a cooling tower is to cool 
liquid water, which is done by two mechanisms. The primary cooling mechanism is through
evaporation, in which water undergoes a phase change from a liquid to a vapor. Heat of 
vaporization is released by the hot water, which serves to decrease the temperature of 
the liquid water moving through the system. The secondary mechanism of cooling is a 
combination of convection and radiation heat transfer from the liquid water to the 
air/surroundings.
