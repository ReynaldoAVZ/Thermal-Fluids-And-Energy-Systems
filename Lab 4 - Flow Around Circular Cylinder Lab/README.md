Flow fields associated with bluff (non-streamlined) bodies are of great significance in many
engineering applications. Typical applications include the flow around aircraft struts, flow
past cabling systems, vehicle aerodynamics, building aerodynamics, and the flow around heat
transfer surfaces, to name a few. In the present lab, we investigate the flow past a circular
cylinder in a uniform crossflow, which represents a classical configuration that displays many
of the features generic to bluff body flows. Sample flow visualization images of this flow field
at a moderat Reynolds number are shown in Figure 1. Of particular interest in bluff body
flows is understanding how the drag coefficient varies with Reynolds number, and how the
pressure coefficient varies with angular position around the object. For the case of flow
around a circular cylinder, the Reynolds number (ReD), drag coefficient (CD), and pressure
coefficient (Cp) are defined, respectively, as
ReD = ρ * U∞ * D / μ , CD = FD / (1/2) * ρ * U∞^2 * Af, and Cp = (Pcyl − P∞) / (1/2) * ρ * U∞^2
